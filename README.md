# Event-Website-React-Redux
Application for managing Users and Events


<h2>Specification of this task</h2>

You will be developing a simple app called Eventio which allows registered users to sign up for
and create events. The app has to contain 5 pages: Login, Events List, Event Detail, Create Event,
User Profile. Also, there is an optional page - Sign Up. Treat this app as an MVP of a much larger
project that could scale and grow one day.


<h3>Login</h3>

<h3>Event List</h3>

After logging in, users should be redirected to a list of all events. Each event should have brief
information about its capacity and a link to more detailed information about the event (Event
Detail page) as well as a button to attend the event.

Each event on the list should include:

● title

● description

● date

● organizer

● number of attendees / capacity

● attend/unattend button


<h3>Event Detail</h3>

The Event Detail page should include:

● title

● description

● date

● organizer

● number of attendees / capacity

● list of attendees

● attend/unattend button

● update event button (organizer only)

● delete button (organizer only)


<h3>Create Event</h3>

On this page users will be able to set the title of their event, select a date, setup capacity and
write a description.

<h3>User Profile</h3>

On this page, users will be able to show a small profile about themselves and list of events that
he or she is planning to attend.


<h3>API</h3>

Find API documentation right here: http://docs.strvtestprojectv2.apiary.io/. Within the email
from your recruiter you will be able to find the API key. The key is unique for your use only.


<h3>DESIGN</h3>

Our design department has prepared a simple look of Eventio. It looks minimalistic,
straightforward and is without any tricky parts. You can find all resources (Sketch file, Previews,
Fonts) here: https://goo.gl/EwFsBc. Keep in mind that following graphic designs is very
important as well as following all required functions offered by the API. The app should be fully
responsive, so don’t forget to also check the designs for the mobile version.
